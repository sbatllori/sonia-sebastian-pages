Dear Sonia, dear Sebastian!!!
You cannot imagine how happy Marco and I are to be here today, together with family and friends, celebrating your love!
Honestly, we thought you would never do it – too old-fashioned – too cheesy – too normal!!!
And then you went even more unconventional: SONIA, on her knees at the Taj Mahal, asking Sebas to marry her. Amazing!!!
It doesn’t get better than this! Thank you, Sonia – only this way could he finally be “caught”! 😉
Sonia, from the moment we met you, you were already part of the family. You made it so easy for us!
You carried Sebastian and all of us through Marco’s accident – and that was not easy. Thank you for that.
You keep surprising us with your creativity, your extraordinary ideas, your athletic spirit, and of course your Catalan temperament.
That your heart beats in Catalunya is so clear – it’s your world.
Last year, in Calella, we could feel it with all our senses.
So today, I solemnly hand over our Sebastian to you –
but if in ten years he is still wearing the same sweater, feel free to buy him a new one!
And if he plays too much chess, don’t hesitate to tap his fingers. 😉
Thank you for your down-to-earth and uncomplicated nature.
By now you manage even our chaotic family gatherings with ease,
and you never say no to a glass of wine at the Augartenweg. Bravo!
You are a smart, beautiful, and fascinating woman –
and you’ve wrapped Sebastian around your little finger so well
that he doesn’t even notice. 😉

SEBASTIAN, ending up in Catalunya was simply meant to be!
We should have known – your love for Spanish, for the language, and for passionate people.
Fascinated by music – band lead singer, piano, saxophone, salsa, modern dance, ballet – none of this is foreign to you, and your curiosity is far from satisfied.
You no longer drive the city lawnmower in your imagination, like as a boy, but now real robotic cleaning machines.
Your Lego machines and vehicles, which you built with so much dedication, you always explained in great detail for hours – and this thread continues now into your career.
School was easy for you.
The wildest part, however, was your adventurous exchange year in Argentina – never would we allow that today – but for you, those were life-shaping experiences.
At the end of your studies, your father and I read your Master’s thesis and didn’t understand a word – all in English and about a subject we knew nothing about. Respect!
You have taken on an important role at home, and we are so proud of you.
You are always there for us and always listen to your siblings.
P.S.: I love those passionate political discussions with you!
You have always known what you wanted – and so you also found your Soni.
We are so happy that you want to walk through life together.

Sonia and Sebastian, it is always a joy to see how much in love you are, how tender and caring you treat each other.
We wish you with all our hearts all the happiness in the world, good health, patience, and blessings on your shared journey of love into the future.
Visca els nuvis!!!
Visca!!!

The time has come. Claudia and I are parents of three wonderful children.
And one of them (Sebastian) is taking the lead.
He is marrying the wonderful Catalan Sonia.
Sebastian and Sonia – I can hardly believe it: you have found each other and fallen in love.
Not in Vorarlberg, but in Berlin – and now you live in Zurich – practically all across Europe.
You are rooted in very different regions.
You, Sebastian, are from Vorarlberg.
You, Sonia, are Catalan. Visca Sonia!
With a Catalan family – not Spanish.
So, here we are: two strongly rooted people are getting married –
a Catalan and a man from Vorarlberg – even if your two passports may suggest something else.
Wedding present:
When it came to your wedding gift, we thought carefully and came up with a proposal:
An investment for Sebastian and Sonia in a Catalan, climate-neutral property –
which we might also use occasionally to spend time in Catalonia –
perhaps a room for us, or even a separate apartment nearby.
Sebastian and Soni:
You fill us with joy and pride.
And here is what you have achieved:
Sebastian, with great dedication in autonomous technology at ABB.
Sonia, in the IT sector at Microsoft.
Both ABB and Microsoft are strong and well-known global companies.
Sebastian, I am so proud of how you move around the world and of what you have accomplished globally (in the USA and Europe).
Visca Catalunya – Visca Sonia and Basti –
and through this: Visca real estate!
Long life in Catalonia!
