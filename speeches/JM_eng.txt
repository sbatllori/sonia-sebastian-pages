No, no, no. Today I’m not going to talk about movies. Seriously? Well… maybe just a little. But only at the beginning.

Today is August 23rd. One month and two days from now, it’ll be September 25th.

Did you know that September 25th is the birthday of five world-famous movie actors? Yes, yes — all five were born on a September 25th: Michael Douglas, Will Smith, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mark Hamill, and Christopher Reeve.

Mark Hamill is Luke Skywalker, and Christopher Reeve is Superman.
Skywalker was the last Jedi, the man with the lightsaber, and Superman was the flying man. They were from different planets: as it says at the beginning of the 9 Star Wars movies, “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…”

Luke Skywalker was born on Tatooine, the planet with two suns, and Superman came to Earth from the planet Krypton.

And on a September 25th, another person was also born — someone who is here today — and her name is... Sònia.
I don’t know where she gets her superpowers from! She wasn’t born on Krypton or on Tatooine. I don’t know which planet she’s from…

Sònia doesn’t need a lightsaber to defend herself. She doesn’t need X-ray vision like Superman to see what’s behind things.

If you don’t know what to do about a problem, talk to Sònia. She’ll have the solution.

Forget about ChatGPT or Copilot — she’ll tell you what to do and she’ll solve the problem.

And… what can I say about Sebas? Well, he’s a very polite guy, very thoughtful, very kind, very cultured, very intelligent, very calm… He’s just a really great guy.

Whose fault is that? Marco and Claudia’s, his parents. No doubt about it.

I’m wrapping up now.

I know that Sonia and Sebas have brains full of drivers, gigs, teras, software, hardware, processors, and robots… but they also have a unique operating system. One just for the two of them:

This operating system is called: LOVE FOR-EVER 3.0
