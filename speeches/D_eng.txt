Good afternoon everyone,

It is 6:34 p.m. on a Saturday, August 23rd, 2025. I’ve been told I need to hand in the speech beforehand so it can be translated and everyone here can follow along, and I thought it was kind of cool to try predicting the exact time. If I nail it and it really *is* 6:34 p.m., I’ll look pretty great. And if I’m wrong, I’ll just stay as mediocre as the rest of you. If anyone feels offended by that — that’s your problem. Just to be clear, I said “as mediocre as all of you,” I didn’t assign a specific level of mediocrity.

When Sònia told me I had 5 minutes to speak, I thought: that’s way too little. But now I’m thinking it might actually be enough time — especially if I don’t waste a whole paragraph trying to guess the time. Sorry, it was funnier in my head. Do "you" think it’s funny? I think it is. Well, not *very* funny. Just a little. I’d love for someone to find it funny enough to say: “funneh.”

Before I continue and actually focus on what I’m here to do, I’d like you to remember: this has been translated into both German and English. In German, “funny” is "witzig", and “thank you” is "danke, so that last joke probably won’t land. Maybe that’s actually a good thing. Let me explain it in German:

“Those who speak Catalan are probably thinking right now that I’m about to explain the joke I just made in Catalan — but no, I’m not doing that at all. Actually, I just want to welcome you and say that most people who don’t speak German think it sounds really ugly… But don’t worry, they would never say that to your face. And if someone ever does say something like that, you can calmly reply: ‘Well, at least we’re not poor.’ Just try to say it with a smile — I don’t want to start any fights.”

Now I’d like to focus — and also apologize — for this chaotic start to my speech. Although, if you think about it, it’s not a *very* sincere apology, because if I really thought it was inappropriate, I could’ve deleted that part and started over. Anyway, moving on.

When someone is given the responsibility of reading at an event like this… you want to live up to the moment. It would be really nice if some of you came up to me later and said, “Hey David, great speech. Funneh.” Do it "only" if you really liked the speech. And if you didn’t — don’t even come near me. I might sound confident and cool now, but it’s all just for show. Truth is, I get super nervous doing these things, my insecurities go through the roof, I sweat a lot — even in the not-so-sexy places — and depending on the moment, my hand trembles while I hold the paper.

And believe me: it really matters to me that what I say here is meaningful to Sebas and Sònia.
And I’m not sure if they’ll like it all that much, because I started by trying to guess the exact time and now I’ve been talking about myself for a full paragraph. Still... it would be pretty awesome if I got the time right. You might think I’ve wasted all my time and haven’t said anything about Sònia or Sebas.But that’s not entirely true — and actually, I think this is more representative than it seems.
 If there’s one thing I feel when I’m around Sònia, it’s a deep sense of safety — and total freedom to say or do whatever I think or feel.
To be creative. To experiment. To never be judged. Everyone who knows Sònia knows how much she values and admires people who make her feel new things, who create, who help her grow and evolve. Some of those influences — like Sebas — are better chosen than others, let’s be honest. As for the "not-so-well-chosen" ones — of course, I won’t name names. It would be really petty to criticize "Antojete" on a day like today. That’s not my style, and I’m not going to do it.

Maybe today "is" the perfect time — and I’m saying this seriously now, without any jokes to lighten the moment — to say something I may not have realized until recently: In a way, I think you’ve always been a bit of a role model for me. You’ve often helped me see the world differently, and you’ve helped me evolve and become the version of David I am today. And I think it’s amazing that we’re still so present in each other’s lives despite the distance, and the way we relate to each other. I feel really lucky to have you in my life. I’m truly happy to be here today. For many reasons — but especially because you’ve found such a wonderful person to walk through life with. To me, you two are a great example of what a healthy, loving relationship should be. I love you both very much, and I hope you have the kind of day you truly deserve, surrounded by your people.

And now that the speech is over and I can finally relax… And as someone who’s a role model to all of us — but who we’re missing today, because he should definitely be sitting somewhere around here — would say: “Ya no te debo nada, que te vaya bien.”

Thank you very much,
